1. Extract Concrete type from base class EquatableByValue that may be agreggated and reused by it and other types (i.e. favor composition over inheritance)
1. Implement decorators: DictionaryByValue, StackByValue, QueueByValue 
1. Find better names for ....ByValue
1. Find a CI to host Value and push first version into nuget.org
1. Profile perf and improve implementations if necessary
